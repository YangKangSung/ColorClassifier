# ColorClassifier
Simple Color Classifier with TensorFlow (Python)

This project was inspired by the following youtube playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y59-frfKR58&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bmMRCIoTi72aNWHo7epX4L .

Please consider supporting the author of that playlist.


The project is based on a crowdsourced database and it uses TensorFlow to build the model and process the data. I also used Tkinter to build a (VERY) simple (quite bad) GUI, just to test the model with user-given data.

If you don't need the GUI, this is the right order to execute the scripts in order to get the data, process them and create and save the model:

1. getData.py

2. processData.py

3. train.py
